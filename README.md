A Web Based Drum Machine

====

This is a pet project of mine that I will continue to expand and improve. This started as an exercise in HTML5 audio and Javascript.

====

Current / known issues:
- Doesn't work on mobile
- Copy / paste hashed session from different browser does not include BPM setting

Future plans / updates
- Mobile friendly design and functionality
- Add an audio mixer and audio effects (i.e. delay, reverb)
